What types of mortgage loans are available in California, and which one is right for me?
Answer: We offer several mortgage options: conventional loans, FHA, VA, jumbo loans, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate terms. The right loan depends on your credit score, down payment, property type, and whether you plan to stay long-term. We can assess your situation and recommend the best fit.

How much down payment do I need to buy a home in California?
Answer: That depends on the loan type. Conventional loans often require 5-20% down; FHA loans can go as low as 3.5%; VA loans may offer 0% down for eligible veterans. Your overall monthly cost (including taxes and insurance) and credit profile also factor in. We help you calculate what‚Äôs realistic in your area.

What is the difference between pre-qualification and pre-approval for a mortgage?
Answer: Pre-qualification is an informal estimate of what you might afford based on basic financial info you give us. Pre-approval is more rigorous‚Äîit involves verifying your income, assets, and credit. Being pre-approved strengthens your offer when you‚Äôre ready to buy.

How do I know what my home is worth in California?
Answer: We provide property valuation support using Comparative Market Analysis (CMA), recent local sales, property condition, and features. In many cases, we coordinate with professional appraisers. This helps both buyers and sellers make smart decisions.

How long does it take to close a home sale in California?
Answer: Typically it takes 30-45 days from accepted offer to closing for residential transactions. Commercial property closings might take longer. Timing depends on inspections, loan underwriting, title/escrow, and how quickly the parties respond.

What fees and costs should I expect when buying a home (closing costs)?
Answer: Besides your down payment, expect costs for loan origination, appraisal fees, title and escrow services, insurance, and property taxes. In California, ‚Äúclosing costs‚Äù often run about 2%-5% of the purchase price. We provide a detailed estimate early so there are no surprises.

Can I refinance my mortgage in California, and when does it make sense?
Answer: Yes, refinancing is possible. It makes sense if interest rates are lower than your current loan, if you‚Äôve built equity, or want to switch loan types (e.g. adjustable to fixed). We help you calculate break-even points so you can see if refinancing would actually save you money.

How is my credit score used in qualifying for a mortgage, and can I improve it beforehand?
Answer: Lenders look at your credit score, payment history, existing debts, and more. The higher your score, the lower the interest you‚Äôll likely pay. You can improve your score by paying bills on time, reducing credit card debt, and avoiding new major credit inquiries before applying.

What licensing and guarantees should I look for in a mortgage lender or real estate broker in California?
Answer: Make sure the lender is registered under California Residential Mortgage Lending Act (CRMLA) or other required licenses, real estate agents/brokers should hold valid California Real Estate Broker License / Salesperson License. Also, a surety bond, compliance with state and federal consumer protection laws, transparency in fees‚Äîall help ensure you're working with a trustworthy provider.

How do FRMI‚Äôs combined mortgage + real estate services benefit me compared to hiring separate companies?
Answer: With FRMI, you get both lending and real estate expertise under one roof. This means better communication, less duplication of work, faster response times, and potentially lower delays. Whether buying or selling, having integrated services can make the process smoother and more efficient.
