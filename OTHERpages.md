### Other Pages and Their Content

The document provides detailed content for additional pages, linked via the navbar dropdowns. These should be separate sub-pages. I've outlined each with their hero, overview, key sections/points, and CTAs, based exactly on the provided details without skipping anything. Yes, there is specific content for each.

Note: The document mentions a "code.md" file with "all the requirement of the website like the client has given us," but no such file is provided here—I've based this entirely on the content.md document. If code.md has additional details (e.g., technical specs), they aren't in this query. All pages should include the navbar and footer for consistency.
